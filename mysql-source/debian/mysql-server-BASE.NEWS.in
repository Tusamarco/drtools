mysql-dfsg-5.0 (5.0.18-9) unstable; urgency=low

  Rotation of the binary logs is now configured in /etc/mysql/my.cnf with
  "expire-logs-days" which defaults to 20 days. The old file
  /etc/mysql/debian-log-rotate.conf should be removed together with
  /etc/cron.daily/mysql-server after this value has been adjusted. Note that
  the old variable defined the number of files whereas the new one defines 
  a time span in days.
