* Crashs on systems with Cyrix or other old i486 CPUs
=====================================================

As reported http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=21765 MySQL will segfault on very
old CPUs that do not have support for the "cpuid" instruction.



* Self-build binaries that are linked against libmysqlclient15 MUST be rebuild!
===============================================================================

This only affects binaries that are build on a Debian unstable/testing system
before 2006-03-31 or version 5.0.19. "objdump -T myprogram | grep MYSQL_5.0"
will give a couple of lines output in such a case.

Until now libmysqlclient.so.15 had versioned symbols provided by a Debian
patch. Now MySQL finally decided to adopt this patch but sadly chosed a
different symbol name.

Binaries linked against the old version of the library with my symbol name will
not run with the new version with MySQL's symbol name ("version `MYSQL_5.0' not
found"). The actual name /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.15 must stay because else
binaries coming from systems other than Debian would never run on a Debian
server.

So the Debian package had to be renamed from "libmysqlclient15" to
"libmysqlclient15off" and do now conflict with their former version.
